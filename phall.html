        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>From Pullenvale hall website</h3>
        <p>Built in 1938, the hall began its life as a pineapple packing shed on John Woodward’s farm. Pineapples were grown extensively in the area, with the last farm on Grandview road closing in the 1990s. The pineapple continues to be used as a motif at the hall, appearing on promotional materials and often featuring on decorations for events.

        </p>
        <p>The hall was purchased from John Woodward around 1943. At that time, the Pullenvale Progress Association was established and the hall began its role as a community hub. The PPA is a  not for profit association with a volunteer committee which meets monthly and serves as caretaker of the hall. In 1943, against the backdrop of WWII, the PPA hosted a Patriotic Show. This was the starting point for the many subsequent public events. In 1988 Back to Pullenvale began as part of Bicentennial activities and has continued in various forms, most recently the very successful Day in May which included a local business showcase, entertainment, market stalls and children’s activities. 

        </p>
        <p>An important part of the Pullenvale Hall story are the dances, which are held on the 3rd Saturday of the month. Before the purchase of the hall, dances were held at Pullenvale State school, then located at the current site of the Pullenvale Environmental Education Centre. The dances continue to be attended by enthusiasts, both local and throughout the southeast Queensland region. Recently a group of local students have become involved in serving supper to the dancers. This has brought a new energy to the events, while introducing young families to Old Time / New Vogue dance.

        </p>
        <p>In addition to the community days and the dances, the hall holds a popular monthly family friendly event (Friday Night Off) and is well used for many local activities including yoga, karate and Saturday markets as well as being a popular venue for weddings and special celebrations. Many locals also enjoy catching up at The Curious Caravan cafe which is open in the grounds of the hall every weekday morning.  As our local area has grown and evolved, the hall has continued to serve as a vibrant and welcoming gathering place, adapting to the needs of the community.
