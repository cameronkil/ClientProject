                <p>Developed in the late 1800s</p>
                <p>The meet up place most mornings of the week. Where laughter and conversation is exchanged over 
                    coffee.
                </p>
                <p>Also has room for functions and celebrations to be held from small to large groups.</p>
                <p>Is also a pinnacle for cyclists in the area to meet for coffee after a ride as it is located 
                    within the notorious cycle route called 'The Three Fingers'.
                </p>
                <p>Has been constantly repainted and developed for the past couple of decades.</p>
                <p>Overall there is a calming, peaceful and chill vibe that the store gives off that comes from the history
                    and time that it has been in operation. Everyone appreciates it and there is never negativity expressed
                    toward the Brookfield General Store. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
